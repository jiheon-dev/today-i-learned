# Diffie-Hellman algorithm
The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is a cryptographic key exchange protocol developed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. The algorithm allows two parties to generate a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without exchanging the key directly.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. The two parties, Alice and Bob, agree on a public prime number `p` and a base number `g` that is a primitive `root of p`.
2. Alice chooses a secret integer (a) and computes `g^a mod p`, which she sends to Bob.
3. Bob chooses a secret integer (b) and computes `g^b mod p`, which he sends to Alice.
4. Alice and Bob both compute the shared secret key as `g^(ab) mod p`.

The security of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem, which states that given a prime number p, a base g, and a number x, it is computationally infeasible to find an integer a such that g^a mod p = x.

The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is widely used in modern cryptography, particularly in key exchange protocols for secure communication over the Internet, such as TLS/SSL. However, it is vulnerable to attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between the two parties. To mitigate this vulnerability, protocols such as Secure Shell (SSH) and TLS/SSL use additional mechanisms such as digital signatures and certificates.
